// area of the variable where the variable can e accessed or used in the program.
// scope of a variable is determined by the block where the variable is declared


// There are two types of scopes 
// 1. Global scope
// 2. Local scope

// GLOBAL SCOPE:
// A variable declared in the global scope can be accessed from any part of the program
// whatever we declare in outside the main function is known as global 
// kaha se bhi access kr skte hai usko


// LOCAL SCOPE
// A variable declared in the local scope can be accessed only within that block where the variable is declared
// like variables declared in the if-else , loops , functions , block of code { } are defined as local
